create a notifictaion:
            notify({
                title: 'Simple Message',
                msg: 'Everything\'s going well...'
            });

default delay is 10s. This may be changed by the delay option
            notify({
                title: 'Another Message',
                msg: 'This message has a shorter delay',
                delay: 3000
            });

at the moment there are two additional styles; success (green) and error (red).
            notify({
                title: 'Update OK',
                msg: 'Everything went better than expected',
                style: 'success'
            });

messages can be updated after they have been displayed. simply keep a reference to the message, then call it's update method.
            var msg = notify({
                title: 'Uploading file',
                msg: 'file is being uploaded to the server',
                delay: -1 // -1 = display indefinitely
            });

now, once the file has been uploaded, (or there's an error) we can update the message accordingly
            msg.update({
                title: 'File uploaded',
                msg: 'Your file has been uploaded to the server',
                delay: 4000,
                style: 'success'
            });
